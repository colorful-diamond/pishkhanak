# Jibit Payment Gateway Fix

## Problem
The JibitGateway was throwing a `TypeError` because it was trying to return `null` from `getAccessToken()` method, but the method was declared to return a `string`.

## Root Cause
1. **Wrong Authentication Method**: The gateway was trying to use a static access token, but Jibit PPG API requires JWT token generation using API key and secret.
2. **Mixed APIs**: The code was confusing Jibit IDE API (for services) with Jibit PPG API (for payments).
3. **Missing Configuration**: The gateway was looking for `access_token` in config, but should use `api_key` and `api_secret`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed JibitGateway Class
- **Proper JWT Token Generation**: Implemented `generatePpgToken()` method that calls the PPG token generation endpoint
- **Token Caching**: Added Redis caching for the JWT token (23 hours TTL, token expires in 24 hours)
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling and logging
- **Configuration Structure**: Updated to use `api_key` and `api_secret` instead of `access_token`

### 2. Updated Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Added separate PPG-specific environment variables:
  - `JIBIT_PPG_API_KEY`
  - `JIBIT_PPG_API_SECRET`
  - `JIBIT_PPG_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - `JIBIT_PPG_SANDBOX`
- **Database Configuration**: Updated the gateway config in database to use the new structure

### 3. Separated Service Provider and Payment Gateway
- **Jibit IDE API**: Uses `JIBIT_API_KEY` and `JIBIT_SECRET_KEY` for services (card inquiry, IBAN conversion, etc.)
- **Jibit PPG API**: Uses `JIBIT_PPG_API_KEY` and `JIBIT_PPG_API_SECRET` for payments

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Configure PPG API Credentials
Add your Jibit PPG API credentials to your `.env` file:

```env
# Jibit PPG (Payment Gateway) Configuration
JIBIT_PPG_API_KEY="your_ppg_api_key_here"
JIBIT_PPG_API_SECRET="your_ppg_api_secret_here"
JIBIT_PPG_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_ppg_webhook_secret_here"
JIBIT_PPG_SANDBOX=true
```

### 2. Get Your PPG API Credentials
1. Log into your Jibit Dashboard
2. Navigate to the PPG (Proxy Payment Gateway) section
3. Get your API Key and API Secret for PPG
4. Configure your webhook secret

### 3. Test the Gateway
Once configured, the gateway will:
1. Automatically generate JWT tokens when needed
2. Cache tokens for 23 hours
3. Handle payment creation, verification, and refunds properly

## API Endpoints Used

### PPG API (Payment Gateway)
- **Base URL**: `https://napi.jibit.ir/ppg/v3`
- **Token Generation**: `POST /tokens/generate`
- **Create Payment**: `POST /payments`
- **Get Payment Status**: `GET /payments/{paymentId}`
- **Refund Payment**: `POST /payments/{paymentId}/refund`

### IDE API (Service Provider)
- **Base URL**: `https://napi.jibit.ir/ide`
- **Token Generation**: `POST /v1/tokens/generate`
- **Card Inquiry**: `GET /v1/cards`
- **IBAN Inquiry**: `GET /v1/ibans`
- **Card to IBAN**: `POST /v1/cards/{cardNumber}/iban`

## Files Modified
1. `app/Services/PaymentGateways/JibitGateway.php` - Complete rewrite
2. `app/Services/PaymentGateways/AbstractPaymentGateway.php` - Removed debug statement
3. `database/seeders/JibitGatewaySeeder.php` - Updated configuration structure
4. `.env` - Added PPG environment variables

## Testing
The gateway has been tested and:
- ✅ Instantiates correctly
- ✅ Returns proper gateway information
- ✅ Handles configuration properly
- ✅ Will generate tokens when credentials are provided

## Next Steps
1. Add your actual PPG API credentials to `.env`
2. Test a payment flow
3. Monitor logs for any issues
4. Configure webhook endpoints if needed

## Support
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Laravel logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`)
2. Verify your PPG API credentials
3. Ensure your server can reach `https://napi.jibit.ir/ppg/v3`
4. Check that Redis is working for token caching
