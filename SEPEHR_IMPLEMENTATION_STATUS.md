## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
SEPEHR_TERMINAL_ID=12345678    # 8-digit terminal ID from Sepehr
SEPEHR_SANDBOX=true            # true for testing, false for production
SEPEHR_GET_METHOD=false        # false for POST callbacks, true for GET
SEPEHR_ROLLBACK_ENABLED=false  # Enable after contacting Sepehr support
```

### Database Setup
The gateway integrates seamlessly with existing payment infrastructure:
- Uses existing `payment_gateways` table
- Uses existing `gateway_transactions` table
- Uses existing `gateway_transaction_logs` table

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Automated Tests
- Full integration test suite with 20+ test methods
- Coverage for all payment types and validation scenarios
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Configuration validation testing

### Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Test the gateway
php artisan test:sepehr --amount=10000

# Run specific payment type tests
php artisan test:sepehr bill-payment --bill-id=1234567890123 --pay-id=9876543210 --amount=25000
php artisan test:sepehr mobile-topup --mobile=09123456789 --operator=0 --amount=20000

# Test in sandbox mode
php artisan test:sepehr --sandbox
```

## ðŸ“‹ Production Checklist
