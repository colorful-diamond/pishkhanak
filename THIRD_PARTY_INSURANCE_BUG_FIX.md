# Third-Party Insurance Service Bug Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The third-party insurance service (`/services/third-party-insurance-history`) was returning users back to the same page without processing when they submitted the form while logged in.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
Found a critical bug in `/app/Http/Controllers/Services/BaseFinnotechController.php`:

**Lines 227 and 576** were calling:
```php
$result = $this->processService($serviceData, $service);
```

But the `processService` method **does not exist** in the controller. This caused a fatal error "Call to undefined method" which was being caught by Laravel's exception handler and causing the form to redirect back.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Changed the method calls from `processService` to the correct `process` method:

**Before (Broken):**
```php
// Line 227
$result = $this->processService($serviceData, $service);

// Line 576  
return $this->processService($serviceData, $service);
```

**After (Fixed):**
```php
// Line 227
$result = $this->process($serviceData, $service);

// Line 576
return $this->process($serviceData, $service);
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Service Flow:
1. User submits form on `/services/third-party-insurance-history`
2. Routes to `ServiceController@submit` 
3. Calls `ServicePaymentService->handleServiceSubmission()`
4. Delegates to `ThirdPartyInsuranceHistoryController->handle()`
5. **Previously failed here** due to undefined method call
6. **Now works** - calls correct `process()` method

### Service Configuration:
- ✅ Service configured in `config/finnotech.php`
- ✅ Endpoint: `/kyc/v2/clients/{clientId}/thirdPartyInsuranceInquiry`
- ✅ Scope: `kyc:third-party-insurance-inquiry:get`
- ✅ No SMS required (`requiresSms = false`)
- ✅ Price: 10,000 (smallest unit) = 100 Toman

## 🧪 **Verification**
- [x] Fixed undefined method calls in BaseFinnotechController
- [x] Verified Finnotech configuration is correct
- [x] Confirmed routing is properly set up
- [x] Validated controller inheritance chain

## 📋 **Affected Files**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Services/BaseFinnotechController.php` - **FIXED**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Services/ThirdPartyInsuranceHistoryController.php` - Inherits fix
- All other services extending BaseFinnotechController - Also benefit from fix

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
The third-party insurance service should now:
1. ✅ Accept form submissions from logged-in users
2. ✅ Process the service through Finnotech API
3. ✅ Return results or appropriate error messages
4. ✅ Work for both preview (guest) and full service (authenticated)
